# Gigaupload: a simple file uploader

This is a simple file uploading utility similar to (but hopefully less shady than) megaupload. Hence the amazingly creative name.

This project was developed as an exercise to gather experience with nodejs webapps.  

# How to deploy

Check out gigaupload and run

```
npm run start
```

Then open `localhost:8080` in your browser. 

If you wish to start with a different port (for example 3000), run:

```
PORT=3000 npm run start
```
